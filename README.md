# Hide AI

A WordPress plugin that hides AI buttons and links in the admin area.

## But why?

The purpose of this app is not to discourage the use of AI. However, theme and plugin developers are injecting buttons and links into core interfaces of the WordPress admin area, as well as in the Gutenburg editor.

This plugin is for WordPress users who want a clutter-free interface, without AI buttons and options taking up space.

## Details

The areas in which AI buttons and links are hidden are limited to core interfaces such as the Media Gallery, Gutenburg, Posts, Pages, and other settings or configuration pages. The intent is not to alter interfaces specific to plugins that offer these AI options, but there is no guarantee as, for example, the elements on those pages may make use of the same CSS classes.

## Installation and Use

Simply install and activate the plugin. That's it! There are no setting or options. The plugin takes action only in the admin area, and will automatically hide content from known sources.

## "The plugin doesn't hide this button"

This plugin will be a constantly growing project. If you have a theme or plugin that is injecting an AI link or button that isn't covered, please submit an issue to the [GitHub project](https://github.com/andrewhoyer/wp-hide-ai/issues).
