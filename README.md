# Hide AI

A WordPress plugin that hides AI buttons and links in the admin area.

## Description

This plugin is for WordPress users who want a clutter-free interface, without AI buttons and options taking up space.

The point is not to discourage the use of AI in general. In fact, AI was used in research and development, and creation of assets for this plugin. However, theme and plugin developers are injecting buttons and links into core interfaces of the WordPress admin area, as well as in the Gutenburg editor, and it is these areas that this plugin is meant to clean up.

## Details

The areas in which AI buttons and links are hidden are limited to core interfaces such as the Media Gallery, Gutenburg, Posts, Pages, and other settings or configuration pages. Plugin setting pages, page editors, etc will be considered on a case-by-case basis but are likely something for the future.

## Plugins and Themes

The plugin hides AI options generated by the following:

* Elementor
* Otter Blocks
* PostX
* Rank Math SEO
* Spectra

## Installation and Use

Simply install and activate the plugin. That's it! There are no setting or options. The plugin takes action only in the admin area, and will automatically hide content from known sources.

## FAQ

### Why am I still seeing certain AI buttons or links even after installing the plugin?

This plugin will be a constantly growing project. If you have a theme or plugin that is injecting an AI link or button that isn't covered, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/andrewhoyer/wp-hide-ai/issues).

Also, if the AI option you are seeing is part of that plugin's interface, it may fall outside the scope of what Hide AI is trying to do. The objective is to clean up the core areas of the admin interface (media, posts, pages, etc).
