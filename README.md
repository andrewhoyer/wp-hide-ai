# Hide AI

A WordPress plugin that hides AI buttons and links in the admin area.

## Description

This plugin is for WordPress users who want a clutter-free interface, without AI buttons and options taking up space.

The point is not to discourage the use of AI in general. In fact, AI was used in research and development, and creation of assets for this plugin. However, theme and plugin developers are injecting buttons and links into core interfaces of the WordPress admin area, the Gutenburg editor, and even their own workflows.

## Details

AI options are hidden anywhere in the WordPress admin area including the dashboard, admin toolbar, sidebar, and any other workflow that exists in the admin area.

Hide AI does not concern itself with plugins that are specifically and exclusively about AI, but rather with ones that are layering AI on top of their core service.

## Plugins and Themes

The plugin hides AI options generated by the following:

* All in One SEO
* Elementor
* Otter Blocks
* PostX
* Rank Math SEO
* SeedProd
* Spectra
* WPCode
* Yoast

Simply install and activate the plugin. That's it! There are no setting or options. The plugin takes action only in the admin area, and will automatically hide content from known sources.

## FAQ

### Why am I still seeing certain AI buttons or links even after installing the plugin?
