A WordPress plugin that hides AI buttons and links in the admin area.

== Description ==

The purpose of this app is not to discourage the use of AI in general. However, theme and plugin developers are injecting buttons and links into core interfaces of the WordPress admin area, as well as in the Gutenburg editor.

This plugin is for WordPress users who want a clutter-free interface, without AI buttons and options taking up space.

== How to use ==

Simply install and activate the plugin. That's it! There are no setting or options. The plugin takes action only in the admin area, and will automatically hide content from known sources.

== Plugins and Themes ==

As a proof-of-concept, the initial release of the plugin hides AI options generated by plugins of various types (a page editor, an add-on plugin, and an SEO plugin):

* Elementor
* PostX
* Rank Math SEO

== Developers ==

If you're interested in furthering the development of the Hide AI plugin, please find the project on GitHub:
