A WordPress plugin that hides AI buttons and links in the admin area.

== Description ==

This plugin is for WordPress users who want a clutter-free interface, without AI buttons and options taking up space.

The point is not to discourage the use of AI in general. In fact, AI was used in research and development, and creation of assets for this plugin. However, theme and plugin developers are injecting buttons and links into core interfaces of the WordPress admin area, as well as in the Gutenburg editor, and it is these areas that this plugin is meant to clean up.

== Details ==

The areas in which AI buttons and links are hidden are limited to core interfaces such as the Media Gallery, Gutenburg, Posts, Pages, and other settings or configuration pages. Plugin setting pages, page editors, etc will be considered on a case-by-case basis but are likely something for the future.

== How to use ==

Simply install and activate the plugin. That's it! There are no settings or options. The plugin takes action only in the admin area, and will automatically hide content from known sources.

== Plugins and Themes ==

The plugin hides AI options generated by the following:

* Elementor
* Otter Blocks
* PostX
* Rank Math SEO
* Spectra

If you use a plugin or theme that is adding AI buttons to the interface, please submit a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hide-ai/">Support request</a> to have it included in a later version:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I help? =

There are a few ways you can help make Hide AI better and support more development:

* Install it on WordPress sites you manage or are developing
* Tell your friends, write a blog post, mention it on social media, etc
* Follow the <a href="https://github.com/andrewhoyer/wp-hide-ai/">project on GitHub</a>
* Add a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hide-ai/">Support request</a> with additional AI options that can be hidden

= Why am I still seeing certain AI buttons or links even after installing the plugin?

Care is taken to hide only specific interface elements, and so they must be included on a case-by-case basis. If you know which plugin or theme is adding the AI buttons to your interface, please add a request to the support forum:

<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hide-ai/">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hide-ai/</a>

Also, if the AI option you are seeing is part of that plugin's interface, it may fall outside the scope of what Hide AI is trying to do. The objective is to clean up the core areas of the admin interface (media, posts, pages, etc).
